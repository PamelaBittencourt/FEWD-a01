### My background

I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Graphic Design. After years of working as a designer creating layouts for websites, I discovered a huge opportunity to get involved in programming so I decided to quit my job in Brazil, move to the USA, and expand my horizons. 
Although I have experience in the industry, I felt limited because of my inability to code and create in-depth comprehensive sites. My current knowledge in graphic programs only allows me to design, and that is what has pulled me towards coding and web design. 

I started a Web Development course at San Diego Continue Education (SDCE) to experience new technologies, reach professional goals, learn valuable skills, and be able to work as an independent contractor creating my own original websites. I have been learning so much and would like to take this knowledge and apply it to my field. 

### My goals:
* Get knowlodge in Coding
* Be able to work in my field
* Start a new carrer as a Web Designer
* Receive a Certificate in Web Developer
* Apply to Mesa College

With your help I will be able to get a transfer to San Diego Mesa College and earn a [Certificate of Achievement in Web Design](http://www.sdmesa.edu/academics/academic-programs/web-development.shtml).
